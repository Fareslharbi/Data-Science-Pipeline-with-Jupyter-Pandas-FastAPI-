# Data Science Pipeline with Jupyter, Pandas, FastAPI

This project is a data science pipeline that combines the power of Jupyter, Pandas, and FastAPI to perform data analysis, preprocessing, and serve the results through a RESTful API.

## Features

- **Jupyter**: Jupyter notebooks are used for interactive data exploration, visualization, and model development.
- **Pandas**: Pandas library is utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation tasks.
- **FastAPI**: FastAPI is used to create a RESTful API that serves the processed data.
- **Data Science Pipeline**: The project demonstrates a typical data science pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and API development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that the following software and libraries are installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- FastAPI
- FastAPI-CSV

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install pandas jupyter fastapi fastapi-csv
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

4. Start Jupyter Notebook by running the command:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the provided Jupyter notebook files (`data_analysis.ipynb` and `model_training.ipynb`) and follow the instructions within the notebooks to perform data analysis and model training.

6. Once the analysis and model training are completed, you can start the FastAPI server by running the command:

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the FastAPI server locally, and you can access the API endpoints to retrieve the processed data.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to access the FastAPI Swagger documentation.

2. Explore the available endpoints and their input/output data formats.

3. Use the provided API endpoints to retrieve the processed data or make predictions based on the trained model.

4. You can also modify the Jupyter notebooks to suit your specific data analysis and model training needs.
